AI & DEFECT DETECTION FEATURES - QUICK START
=============================================

WHAT WAS ADDED
==============

1. Defect Detection Module (defect_detection.py)
   - Detects UNEVEN RISE (fermentation uniformity)
   - Detects DENSE SPOTS (hard spots in crumb)
   - Severity score 0-100
   - Actionable recommendations

2. ML Classifier Module (ml_simple.py)
   - Train on YOUR bread images
   - Classify new bread as GOOD or PROBLEM
   - Confidence scores
   - No external dataset needed

3. Two New GUI Tabs
   - "Defects" tab for defect analysis
   - "ML Training" tab for classifier

HOW TO USE
==========

DEFECT ANALYSIS (1 minute)
-----------
1. Go to "Defects" tab
2. Select an image in Image Library
3. Click "Analyze Current Image"
4. See severity score, grade, and recommendations
5. Read suggestions for next batch

ML CLASSIFIER (10 minutes setup, then instant predictions)
---
Step 1: Build Training Data
  - Select "good" bread image
  - Click "Add Good Image"
  - Repeat 5-10 times with good images
  - Select "problem" bread image
  - Click "Add Problem Image"
  - Repeat 5-10 times with problem images

Step 2: Train Model
  - Click "Train Model"
  - Wait for message (1-2 seconds)

Step 3: Use for Predictions
  - Select any image
  - Click "Predict Current"
  - Get GOOD/PROBLEM prediction with confidence

COMBINED QA WORKFLOW
===================

1. Analyze batch (Defects tab → Batch Analysis)
2. Get severity scores on all images
3. For suspicious images: Get ML prediction
4. Review recommendations
5. Apply to next batch
6. Quality improves → Model improves

FILES ADDED
===========
- defect_detection.py (350+ lines)
- ml_simple.py (480+ lines)
- ML_AND_DEFECTS.md (comprehensive guide)
