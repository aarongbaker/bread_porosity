- Tips & tricks

### 3. **FEATURES.md** (Comprehensive Guide)

## User Experience Impact

**Before:** "Which README should I read? Which guide has recipe info?"  
**After:** "README.md for overview, FEATURES.md for details, QUICK_START.md for quick reference"

**Finding Information:**
- Feature details? → FEATURES.md (one source of truth)
- Getting started? → QUICK_START.md (clear path)
- Setup help? → INSTALLATION.md (focused guide)
- Lost? → README.md (navigation hub)
